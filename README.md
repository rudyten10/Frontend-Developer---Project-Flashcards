# Frontend-Developer---Project-Flashcards

Description
First, you have to come up with the topic for your memory board. When selecting a theme to work with, remember that your questions and answers shouldnâ€™t be too long. Flashcards can be used as an educational tool for a wide variety of tasks, from learning foreign words and scientific terms to memorizing the birthday dates of your new friends. We chose to make geography themed flashcards that can help you memorize the countries' capitals. You can join us with this idea using a list of national capitals on Wiki, or find another theme that interests you.

Once you have chosen your topic of interest, edit the given HTML code. Add a suitable header for your memory-board and nine <div> elements with question terms (in our case, countries). Don't forget to use a suitable tag for the text.

To preview your intermediate solution hover the mouse pointer over the HTML code to show the browser icons popup, and click the icon that indicates the desired browser. Alternatively, select View | Open in Browser from the main menu and then select the desired browser from the list.

Objectives
1. Make an appropriate title using a <h1> element
2. Create a <div> with the question term for each of the nine cards

Example
The resulting web page should look like something like this:
